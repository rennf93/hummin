# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- `FileSystem` requires `openBinaryReader()` and `openDirReader()`; custom environments must implement them.
- `BinaryReader` requires `scanLines()`.
- `FileSystem` requires `watch()`.
- `Shell.exec()` accepts an argv array besides a shell string, and `ShellExecOptions.onOutput` receives a third `info` argument naming the stream (`stdout` or `stderr`); custom environments must accept both forms and pass the stream.

### Added

- `openBinaryReader()` for bounded positional reads of one opened regular file, with `noFollow` to refuse a final-component symlink.
- `openDirReader()` for paged directory listings that read metadata only for returned entries.
- Argv form of `exec()`, which runs a program without a shell.
- `createEnvConformance()` and `registerEnvConformance()` in `@earendil-works/pi-durable/testing` for checking custom `ExecutionEnv` implementations.
- `settings.progress` with `partialIntervalMs` and `outputIntervalMs` configures how often generation partials and running tool output are committed; defaults stay 100 ms ([#10357](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10357))
- `ShellExecOptions.window` and `ShellOutputInfo.skipped`: an environment may omit shell output outside the caller's retained tail and report the omission, so remote environments need not transfer output the caller drops. `ToolExecutionApi.outputWindow` provides the window and `output(chunk, skipped)` counts omissions; the `bash` tool passes them through.
- `BinaryReader.scanLines()` locates and measures a span of lines in one pass inside the environment; `LineScanner`, `StreamDecoder`, `rangeDecoder()` and `startsWithBom()` in `@earendil-works/pi-durable/env` let other environments decode and scan exactly like `NodeExecutionEnv`.
- `FileSystem.watch()` reports changes to files and directories, recursive with excludes, including missing targets, with explicit `overflow` and `error` and a `native` or `polling` mode. `NodeExecutionEnv` polls on Windows (native watchers there keep directories open, which blocks renaming their parents) and on network and FUSE file systems, and on macOS rescans shortly after installing native watchers because FSEvents misses changes made right after `fs.watch` returns; its `watch` option sets the mode, poll interval, and directory limit.

### Changed

- The `read` tool reads only the file's header, one scan, and the lines it shows, instead of loading the whole file; its results are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `NodeExecutionEnv.flushFile()` on a directory fails with `is_directory` on Windows, as on POSIX.
- Tail-retained tool output no longer depends on when progress commits happened: a progress snapshot compacted the stored output to the kept window, which could move where a later window's first line started.
- `NodeExecutionEnv` shell output and text line readers no longer drop a U+FEFF that follows a chunk boundary; Node's streaming `TextDecoder` with BOM handling dropped it, unlike decoding all of the bytes at once.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-04

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- The package now tracks the rewritten upstream durable runtime: a durable task runtime with an openable Harness (registry and conversation config), first chat and tool turns, conversation abort with ownership cascades and subagent handles, structured concurrency (task ownership, waiting and completing holds, bottom-up abort), asynchronous SQLite storage (queries executed by SQL text with per-connection statement caching, transaction handles for callbacks), compaction and overflow, extensions and per-conversation agents, lifecycle conformance, and a task graph view. Distinct provider session identities are persisted per conversation and forwarded for prompt-cache and session affinity.

## [1.2.10] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Added document states and buffered watches for session documents.
- Checkpoint predicates now receive the deltas accumulated since the base checkpoint.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-26

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Breaking Changes

- Reordered Storage scan arguments so the limit precedes the cursor.
- Added the required conversation-visible `Storage.entry(conversationId, id, context)` overload.
- Split `Tx.createConversation()` from `Tx.forkConversation()`, replaced raw conversation-record input, and require explicit ownerless or task ownership.
- Replaced untyped numeric record IDs and the `TaskRef` wrapper with erased branded numeric ID types, including result-typed `TaskId<R>`, separately branded commit sequences, and generic `Storage.mintId()`.
- Made task conversation membership immutable after task creation.
- Added `ConversationQuery` to Storage and transaction conversation scans.
- Added required `StoredDocument.deltasSinceBase` to Storage document reads.

### Added

- Added transactional Sessions with typed durable documents, task creation, snapshots, retirement, and commit publications.
- Added document checkpoint selection, lazy version migration, and `Session.snapshotAsOf()` for rewindable conversation documents.
- Added policy-driven backend-side conversation document copying when creating forks.
- Added indexed conversation ownership queries and guaranteed no-effect Storage rejection handling.
- Added incarnation-bound read-only Chord document states and serialized asynchronous document watches with bounded exact-frame buffering.
- Added `deltasSinceBase` checkpoint predicate information so definitions can bound replay without value counters.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-22

## [0.87.1] - 2026-09-22
