# Using hummin

This page collects day-to-day usage details that do not fit on the quickstart page.

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface has four main areas:

- **Startup header** - shortcuts, loaded context files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, tool results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - where you type; border color indicates the current thinking level
- **Footer** - working directory, session name, token/cache usage, cost, context usage, and current model. Totals include assistant responses, usage reported by tools, and summary generation.

The editor can be replaced temporarily by built-in UI such as `/settings` or by custom extension UI.

### Editor Features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Press Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line input | Shift+Enter, or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal |
| Copy response | Ctrl+X copies the selected message in `/tree`; otherwise it copies the last assistant message, or the active fullscreen text selection when `fullscreenCopyOnSelect` is disabled |
| Images | Paste with Ctrl+V, Alt+V on Windows, or drag into the terminal |
| Shell command | `!command` runs and sends output to the model |
| Hidden shell command | `!!command` runs without sending output to the model |
| External editor | Ctrl+G opens `externalEditor`, `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, Notepad on Windows, or `nano` elsewhere |

See [Keybindings](keybindings.md) for all shortcuts and customization.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the editor to open command completion. Extensions can register custom commands, skills are available as `/skill:name`, and prompt templates expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | Manage OAuth or API-key credentials |
| [`/llama`](llama-cpp.md) | Download, load, and unload llama.cpp router models |
| `/model` | Switch models; Ctrl+S in the picker saves the startup default |
| `/thinking` | Switch thinking level; Ctrl+S in the picker saves the startup default |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Theme, message delivery, transport, and other preferences |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session file, ID, messages, tokens, and cost |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/trust` | Save project trust decision for future sessions |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optionally with custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML or JSONL |
| `/import <file>` | Import and resume a session from a JSONL file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and context files |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit hummin |

hummin extensions also register these commands (details in the hummin product docs):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/context` | Show what is in the current context window |
| `/cost` | Show token and cost totals for the session |
| `/agents` | Inter-session messaging status and registration name |
| `/team` | Shared team task board across sessions |
| `/cron` | Scheduled hummin runs |
| `/mcp` | MCP server status and tools |
| `/hooks` | Hook status and activity |
| `/sandbox` | Sandboxed bash status and mode toggle |
| `/bashguard` | Bash command guard status and toggles |
| `/fleet` | Local inference fleet status, start/stop/restart |
| `/status` | Model, context window, fleet health, memory, todo progress |
| `/memory` | Project memory lessons and vault status |
| `/plan` | Plan mode |
| `/todos` | Session todo list |
| `/background` | Running background jobs |
| `/rewind` | Rewind the session to an earlier point |
| `/remote-control` | Remote control session pairing |

## Message Queue

You can submit messages while the agent is still working:

- **Enter** queues a steering message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls.
- **Alt+Enter** queues a follow-up message, delivered after the agent finishes all work.
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to the editor.
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to the editor.

On Windows Terminal, Alt+Enter is fullscreen by default. Remap it as described in [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) if you want hummin to receive the shortcut.

Configure delivery in [Settings](settings.md) with `steeringMode` and `followUpMode`.

## Sessions

Sessions are saved automatically to `~/.hummin/agent/sessions/`, organized by working directory.

```bash
hummin -c                  # Continue most recent session
hummin -r                  # Browse and select a session
hummin --no-session        # Ephemeral mode; do not save
hummin --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
hummin --session <path|id> # Use a specific session file or session ID
hummin --session-id <id>   # Use an exact project session ID, creating it if missing
hummin --fork <path|id>    # Fork a session into a new session file
```

Useful session commands:

- `/session` shows the current session file and ID.
- `/tree` navigates the in-file session tree and can summarize abandoned branches.
- `/fork` creates a new session from an earlier user message.
- `/clone` duplicates the current active branch into a new session file.
- `/compact` summarizes older messages to free context.

See [Sessions](sessions.md) and [Compaction](compaction.md) for details.

## Context Files

hummin loads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` at startup from:

- `~/.hummin/agent/AGENTS.md` for global instructions
- parent directories, walking up from the current working directory
- the current directory

If a directory contains `AGENTS.override.md`, hummin loads it instead of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from that directory. Context files from other directories still layer normally.

Use context files for project conventions, commands, safety rules, and preferences. Disable loading with `--no-context-files` or `-nc`.

### System Prompt Files

Replace the default system prompt with:

- `.pi/SYSTEM.md` for a project
- `~/.hummin/agent/SYSTEM.md` globally

Append to the default prompt without replacing it with `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` in either location.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, hummin asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local settings, resources, or project `.agents/skills` and has no saved decision for the folder or a parent folder in `~/.hummin/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows hummin to load `.pi/settings.json` and `.pi` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Before the trust decision, hummin loads only context files, user/global extensions, and CLI `-e` extensions so they can handle the `project_trust` event. Project-local extensions, project package-managed extensions, and project settings are loaded only after the project is trusted. This split also applies when switching to a session from a different cwd whose trust has not been resolved in the current process.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without an applicable saved trust decision, they use `defaultProjectTrust` from global settings: `ask` (default) and `never` ignore those project resources, while `always` trusts them. Pass `--approve`/`-a` or `--no-approve`/`-na` to override project trust for one run.

If no extension or saved decision applies, `defaultProjectTrust` controls the fallback behavior. Set it to `"ask"`, `"always"`, or `"never"` in `~/.hummin/agent/settings.json`, or change it with `/settings`.

`hummin config` and package commands use the same project trust flow, except `hummin update` never prompts. Pass `--approve` to trust project-local settings for one command or `--no-approve` to ignore them.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions, including trust for the immediate parent folder. It writes `~/.hummin/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart hummin for changes to take effect.


## Exporting and Sharing Sessions

Use `/export [file]` to write a session to HTML.

Use `/share` to upload a private GitHub gist with a shareable HTML link.

If you use hummin for open source work and want to publish sessions for model, prompt, tool, and evaluation research, see [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). It publishes sessions to Hugging Face datasets.

## CLI Reference

```bash
hummin [options] [--] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Setup Commands

```bash
hummin init [--project] [--yes] [--memory] [--vault-dir <dir>] [--instances <urls>]
hummin auth <command>       # Print credentials or check provider readiness
```

`hummin init` is an interactive setup that writes real settings (global by default, per-project with `--project`) so hummin works without shell exports: default provider/model, memory, vault directory, and local instances. Environment variables still override stored settings when present.

`hummin auth` prints credentials or checks provider readiness, for example `hummin auth check --provider openai` or `hummin auth print-api-key --provider openai`. Pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

### Package Commands

```bash
hummin install <source> [-l]   # Install package, -l for project-local
hummin remove <source> [-l]    # Remove package
hummin uninstall <source> [-l] # Alias for remove
hummin update [source|self|pi] # Update packages; self-update requires HUMMIN_ALLOW_UPSTREAM_UPDATE=1
hummin update --all            # Update packages; reconcile pinned git refs
hummin update --extensions     # Update packages only; reconcile pinned git refs
hummin update --models         # Refresh model catalogs only
hummin update --self           # Update the CLI installation (blocked by default on this fork)
hummin update --extension <src> # Update one package
hummin list                    # List installed packages
hummin config                  # Enable/disable package resources
```

These commands manage packages and `hummin update` can update the CLI installation; self-update is blocked by default because it would replace this fork with upstream pi (`HUMMIN_ALLOW_UPSTREAM_UPDATE=1` forces it; update with `git pull` in your clone instead). To uninstall hummin itself, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md#uninstall). `hummin config` and project package commands accept `--approve`/`--no-approve` to trust or ignore project-local settings for one command. `hummin update` never prompts for project trust.

See [Packages](packages.md) for package sources and security notes.

In print mode, hummin also reads piped stdin and merges it into the initial prompt:

```bash
cat README.md | hummin -p "Summarize this text"
```

### Model Options

| `--session-id <id>` | Use an exact project session ID, creating it if missing |
| `--fork <path\|id>` | Fork a session file or partial UUID into a new session |
| `--session-dir <dir>` | Custom session storage directory |
| `--no-session` | Ephemeral mode; do not save |

| `--no-tools`, `-nt` | Disable all tools |

Built-in tools: `read`, `bash`, `powershell` (Windows), `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`.

### Resource Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e`, `--extension <source>` | Load an extension from path, npm, or git; repeatable |
| `--no-extensions` | Disable extension discovery |
| `--skill <path>` | Load a skill; repeatable |
| `--no-skills` | Disable skill discovery |
| `--prompt-template <path>` | Load a prompt template; repeatable |
| `--no-prompt-templates` | Disable prompt template discovery |
| `--theme <path>` | Load a theme; repeatable |
| `--no-themes` | Disable theme discovery |

Combine `--no-*` with explicit flags to load exactly what you need, ignoring settings. Example:

```bash
hummin --no-extensions -e ./my-extension.ts
```

### Other Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--system-prompt <text>` | Replace default prompt; context files and skills are still appended |
| `--append-system-prompt <text>` | Append to system prompt |
| `--tui-mode <mode>` | TUI mode: `regular` (default) or experimental `fullscreen` |
| `--use-theme <name[/name]>` | Set the initial interactive theme for this run without changing settings |
| `--verbose` | Force verbose startup |
| `-a`, `--approve` | Trust project-local files for this run |
| `-na`, `--no-approve` | Ignore project-local files for this run |
| `--` | Stop option parsing; remaining arguments are prompts or `@file` inputs |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version |

In `fullscreen` mode, the transcript scrolls inside the terminal viewport while queued messages, working status, extension widgets, editor, and footer remain fixed at the bottom. Mouse/trackpad input scrolls the region under the pointer; keyboard viewport actions always remain available. Inline images work in terminals that support the Kitty graphics protocol, including Kitty and Ghostty. In iTerm2 they render as text placeholders because its inline-image protocol cannot delete or crop placements during application-owned scrolling. In `regular` mode, hummin uses the main screen and terminal-owned scrollback, and iTerm2 inline images continue to render normally. See [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) for terminal-specific settings and workarounds.

Set **TUI mode** in `/settings` to switch between `regular` and `fullscreen` immediately and choose the default for future sessions. **Fullscreen exit output** controls whether exiting fullscreen prints the final transcript or restores the previous screen and prints only the session resume hint.

### File Arguments

Prefix files with `@` to include them in the message:

```bash
hummin @prompt.md "Answer this"
hummin -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
hummin @code.ts @test.ts "Review these files"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive with initial prompt
hummin "List all .ts files in src/"

# Non-interactive
hummin -p "Summarize this codebase"

# Prompt beginning with a dash
hummin -p -- "- Summarize these points"

# Non-interactive with piped stdin
cat README.md | hummin -p "Summarize this text"

# Named one-shot session
hummin --name "release audit" -p "Audit this repository"

# Different model
hummin --provider openai --model gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with provider prefix
hummin --model openai/gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with thinking level shorthand
hummin --model sonnet:high "Solve this complex problem"

# Limit model cycling
hummin --models "claude-*,gpt-4o"

# Read-only mode
hummin --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "Review the code"

# Disable one extension or built-in tool while keeping the rest available
hummin --exclude-tools ask_question
```

## Design Principles

hummin keeps the core small and pushes workflow-specific behavior into extensions, skills, prompt templates, and packages.

It intentionally does not include permission popups; MCP, sub-agents, plan mode, to-dos, background bash, and related workflows ship as bundled hummin extensions or can be built and installed as extensions or packages. External tools such as containers and tmux remain first-class citizens.

For the full rationale, read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/).
